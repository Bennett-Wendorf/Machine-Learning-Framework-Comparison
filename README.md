# Problem Statement

There are an increasingly large number of machine learning frameworks available that all allow their users to build and train neural networks for any purpose. Each option has its own nuances, strengths, and limitations. With so many possibilities, it is almost certain that new users will have a difficult time deciding what to use and how to use it. This project aims to summarize some of the most popular frameworks and compare and contrast how some standard neural networks can be constructed in each.

# Methodology
<!-- TODO: Talk about iris example (Including example of dataset, network structure, etc) -->
<!-- TODO: Talk about MNIST example (On same features as iris) -->
<!-- TODO: Networks to compare -->

# Framework Comparison Metrics
- Control over network structure <!-- (I.e. Can I have different activations per layer, options for layer types like conv, etc) -->
- Ease of data import <!-- (Iris examples are probably better for this since I didn't really test with MNIST) -->
- Loss function specification
- Optimizer specification
- Training loop customization
    - Metrics during training 
- Network evaluation

# Pytorch <!-- Talk about Pytorch on the comparison metrics, and include any unique details if relevant -->

# Scikit-learn <!-- TODO: Talk about Scikit-learn on the comparison metrics, and include any unique details if relevant -->

# Tensorflow/Keras <!-- TODO: Talk about Tensorflow/Keras on the comparison metrics, and include any unique details if relevant -->

# Discussion <!-- TODO: Talk about what I like and why. Maybe also what I think would be good for beginners -->
